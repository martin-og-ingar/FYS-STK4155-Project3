# FYS-STK4155-Project3

## This repository contain the source code and report for project 3.

To run this project you can either:

- Run 'python evaluate.py' to evaluate the model on different hyper-parameters, and predict on the test data with the optimal hyper-parameters.
- Run 'python predict.py' to predict with the test data, using the pre-saved model with optimal hyper-parameters.

For both 'evaluate.py' and 'predict.py' you must add a argument, which is the model you want to use. This can be:

- 'ridge' for ridge regression,
- 'dt' for decision trees,
- 'rf' for random forest,
- or 'bagging' for bagging
